Hi, I'm Jay. :wave:

I'm a data scientist currently based in Washington, D.C.

In my day job, I'm a Lead Data Scientist at [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org). We build and deploy machine learning and data science solutions for social impact. We run online [machine learning competitions](https://drivendata.org/competitions) focused on social good applications, where the prize-winning solutions are open-sourced. We also provide [data science professional services](https://drivendata.co/) for social sector organizations. At a previous employer, I worked on machine learning with industrial sensor data for the rail and heavy equipment industries.

These days, I'm primarily working in Python. I also have experience in R, web development, and MATLAB. I develop and maintain [several open-source packages](https://github.com/jayqi).

In my former life, I was a mechanical and aerospace engineer. In graduate school, I studied and researched computational fluid dynamics, control theory, and dynamical systems theory. I've also worked on robotics for space exploration and space systems design.
